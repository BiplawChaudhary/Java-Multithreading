/* INCORRECT implementation of Producer COnsumer problem.
It consists of four classes: Q, the queue that youâ€™re trying to synchronize;
Producer, the threaded object that is producing queue entries; Consumer, the threaded
object that is consuming queue entries; and ProducerConsumerWrong, the tiny class that creates the single Q,
Producer, and Consumer.
